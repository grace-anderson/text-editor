## Description

The **Just Another Text Editor app** is a single-page full-stack text editor application that meets [Progressive Web App (PWA)](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) criteria. Additionally, it features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The app also functions offline.

**Just Another Text Editor app** implements methods for getting and storing data to an [IndexedDB database](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) using the [IndexedDB API (often abbreviated to IDB)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API). The [IDB package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/idb) is a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB featuring a number of methods for storing and retrieving data. 

The app is deployed to [Heroku](https://mighty-inlet-78059.herokuapp.com/), with the code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/grace-anderson/text-editor)
